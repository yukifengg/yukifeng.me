# Yuki Feng's personal website

Built using HTML5 + CSS3, React, Python, and Flask.

[yukifeng.me](http://yukifeng.me) is a personal portfolio website meant to show off my UI and web development skills while also displaying my projects and interests in computer science and design.

I also include my side projects including food fraud genome analysis research with DNALC Cold Harbor Learning Center and NannyHood, a passion project researching the socio-economic and psychological implications of childcare.
